errors:-
-> Remember to change code to move textfield to the top of soft keyboard to view it properly before
typing. Do this first before doing any changes to a screen working on.
To dos:-
-> The password field in sign up screen is not validated. Have to write code for that.(done)
-> Redirect user to login page after sign up.
-> Also disable back button in sign up and login page.

Remember:-
WillPopScope(
  onWillPop: () async => false,
  child: Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: Text('My Page'),
    ),
    body: Center(
      child: Text('This is my page.'),
    ),
  ),
);
In this example, the onWillPop callback always returns false, which prevents the back button
of the device from navigating back.
